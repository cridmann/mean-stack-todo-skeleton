This is based on the MEAN (mongodb, express, angularjs, nodejs) architecture as seen here: https://github.com/vkarpov15/mean-stack-todo

This skeleton includes:
-authentication (sessions, cookies, restricted pages, password encryption, account lockouts)
-get/post/put commands to a todo document model in mongodb
-REST based routing system
-form validation using mongoose and angularjs

NOTE:
I had to change node_modules/express-sessions/index.js to support the way I was using mongoose.  This change
has not been thoroughly tested.
